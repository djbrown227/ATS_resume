            <p>I am a curious and proactive professional with a deep interest in the transformative power of data on individuals and organizations. I have successfully led initiatives that resulted in significant cost savings through data-driven strategies. I co-founded a sports gambling company, where I also spearheaded the development and sale of sports data analytics solutions. Notably, I was a finalist in the 2022 Open Division MIT Sports Analytics Hackathon.<br><br> I hold a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from The City College of New York and am currently pursuing a Master of Data Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder, online. My recent project involved creating a profitable PGA Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) gambling model that consistently achieves a 1.5% daily return on investment.

                Additionally, I have earned numerous certifications from reputable organizations, including Google, Meta, IBM, DeepLearning.AI, and top universities. These certifications span areas such as risk management, database engineering, software engineering fundamentals, TensorFlow development, Google Cloud applications, business intelligence, statistical inference, energy production, DevOps, project management, AI ethics, and advanced data analytics, demonstrating my extensive skills acquisition across the data science field.</p>
